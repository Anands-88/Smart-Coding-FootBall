Smart Coding FootBall

Note: Read all the questions before you start coding.
There will be 2 teams with 5 players in each team, each player will get to hit a penalty shot, a random number will be generated when a penalty shot is hit, if the generated random number is in between the given range (10-15) then it's a goal or it's a miss. Note: Range will be a user input. Finally display the winner based on the number of goals scored.

From the above question, make the number team and players dynamic and then players have to shoot in an alternative way from each team. The number of rounds is also added. ex: 
3 team 3 players and 2 rounds
P1 from team-1 -> first shot -> 8 => miss
P1 from team-2 -> first shot -> 11 => goal
P1 from team-3 -> first shot -> 12 => goal

P2 from team-1 -> second shot -> 8 => miss
P2 from team-2 -> second shot -> 11 => goal
P2 from team-3 -> second shot -> 12 => goal …… and so on.
Finally display which team has won

From the above question , if a player hit a goal he will get 100rs . Display who has the highest money and which team has the highest money.
